# BrightHive DevOps Exercise

## Introduction

Hello there! Thank you for your interest in joining the [BrightHive](https://brighthive.io) Engineering team.

The purpose of this short exercise is to give you an opportunity to familiarize yourself with our technology stack while providing our technical interview team with an idea of your approach to solving technical problems. We believe that asking you to write code on a whiteboard or doing live coding exercises isn't a great way to have a technical discussion.

Instead, we ask you to do at most a few hours of work, on your time, to complete this exercise. During the interview we will discuss the technical decisions you've made, the resulting work artifacts, and how your solution may change given different requirements.

## Next Steps

1. Take a few minutes to read up on our [Technology Stack](TECHNOLOGY.md) to familiarize yourself with the tools we use here at BrightHive.

2. Review the [Logistics](LOGISTICS.md) section of the document the learn about the parameters of the DevOps activity.

3. Implement your solution to the exercise as described in the [Task Outline](EXERCISE.md) section.

4. Submit your solution as described in the [Logistics](LOGISTICS.md) section.
