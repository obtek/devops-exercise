# BrightHive DevOps Exercise - Technology Stack

The technology stack that you will need for this exercise reflect the core tools that we use at BrightHive. Not familiar with a particular technology? Fear not! All of the software that we use here are designated as **FOSS** (Free or Open Source Software) so there is plenty of documentation to be found online.

## Version Control

### Git/Github

We use [Github](https://www.github.com/) as our source code repository and Git as our version control tool. You should be familiar with Git or some other version control tool (e.g. Subversion, CVS). Bonus if you already have an active Github account and actively contribute code.

## Programming Languages

### Python

We use [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/) for the vast majority of our development. You should be very comfortable with producing modern, clean Python 3 code. We build a lot of APIs and our library of choice for this is the [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) framework. We like it because it provides a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools  that make API development super easy.

### JavaScript

We use [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)) frameworks such as [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) for front-end development. Most of the work that we do tends to live in the middleware and backend tiers, so our use of JavaScript is fairly limited to a handful of tools.

## Container Services

### Docker

We are huge advocates of [Microservices](https://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) and Docker is a critical tool that helps us to realize this architecture style. If you haven't used the technology before, you should at least be comfortable with learning [just enough Docker](http://seankross.com/2017/09/17/Enough-Docker-to-be-Dangerous.html) to complete this exercise.

## Databases

### PostgreSQL

Our database management system of choice is [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/). It's powerful, scalable, free and embraced by the data community. You should be comfortable with relational databases in general. Bonus points if you know how to interact with these kinds of databases using ORM libraries like [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/).

## Deployment

### Amazon Web Services

We use [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) (AWS) a lot for deploying our applications and services. While this exercise doesn't require AWS, candidates with experience working with AWS or similar cloud environment (Azure, Google Cloud, IBM Cloud, etc.) definitely have an advantage.

### Kubernetes (K8s)

We use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for container deployment and orchestration. Though Amazon has support for Kubernetes via [EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) we tend to manage our own clusters outside of the service.

## Other

### Auth Frameworks

Much of our work requires securing sensitive data. We like our candidates to be able to speak to modern authorization and authentication frameworks such as OAuth2 and JSON Web Tokens.

### OpenAPI/Swagger

We use the [OpenAPI specification](https://swagger.io/docs/specification/about/) as the mechanism for documenting our APIs. We expect that our engineers are familiar with or able to quickly pick up the specification.
